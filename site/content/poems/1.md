our situation is a battle  
we punish delicious toast or party to beautiful sausage  
feral love ferocious lunatic friend  
lick my empire, dance like rubbish  
play my stratosphere, mumble your thirst  
give sensation one chance  
trust me


all technology is a worship  
we quench diabolical charm and chant to majestic banana  
lame love georgeous thing gypsy  
eat my street, fiddle my baloney  
nest my universe, surrender your hunger  
wish commotion some choice  
touch me
