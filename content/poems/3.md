surrender no debacle  
drop sugar on her gorgeous muffin  
from winter to sweet drool  
quence his turgid balloon  
loathe an ancient angel  
worship me  
charm me  
tremble like sound and buck fully  
destroy tear tackle beasts  
go touch my heart juice so blue  
give father the power of choice  
love under delicious fortune  
has come calmly
